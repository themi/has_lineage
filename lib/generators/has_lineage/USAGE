Description:
    Explain the generator

Example:
  rails generate has_lineage:migration

  This will create:
    db/migration/add_has_lineage_fields_to_#########.rb

  Once created you will need to modify further depending on your requirements
    if you already have a field that refers to parent object then remove the parent_id line 
    if you donot whish to use the branch option then remove the branch_id line else rename accordingly
    if you donot require counter caching then remove the lineage_children_count line
