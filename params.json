{"name":"Has lineage","tagline":"Hybrid hierarchy - Adjacency and Materialised Path ","body":"# HasLineage\r\n\r\nIs a hierarchical data management tool. It uses Materialised Path for fast lookup queries and also doubles as a sort order for displaying the leafs.  In addition, the Adjacency pattern is used to maintain hierachy integrity to allow the path to be re-adjusted as changes inevidably occur.\r\n\r\nInitially (using Adjacency) I was frustrated by lengthy retrevial times of large trees so I tried out Materialised Path which was lightning quick at retreval but awkward when the tree was modified.  So I had the idea of keeping Adjency in to hold the integrity of the tree while the Materialised path was being adjusted.\r\n\r\n![tree sample diagram](http://hemi.co.nz/signature/has_lineage_tree_path_diag.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'has_lineage'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install has_lineage\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n#### Run migration\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrails generate has_lineage:migration Post\r\n```\r\n\r\nadjust the migration file as required, then...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrake db:migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Add to your model\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  include HasLineage\r\n  has_lineage\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Setup your tree\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nharry = Post.create(:name => \"Harry\")\r\nmary = Post.create(:name => \"Mary\")\r\njohn = Post.create(:name => \"John\")\r\njane = Post.create(:name => \"Jane\")\r\nlarry = Post.create(:name => \"Larry\")\r\ngina = Post.create(:name => \"Gina\")\r\nPost.reset_lineage_tree do\r\n  harry.children << mary\r\n  harry.children << john\r\n  harry.children << jane\r\n  john.children << larry\r\n  john.children << gina\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have not included call_backs to update tree automatically, as maintaining indexes on the lineage path column can be expensive.  Updating the tree should a be a process on its own and once done editing, then reset the tree/s.\r\n\r\n### Navigating\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot             Returns the root of the tree the record is in, self for a root node\r\nparent           Returns the parent of the record, nil for a root node\r\nancestors        Returns a list of ancestors of the record, self is not included\r\nchildren         Returns children of the record\r\nsiblings         Returns siblings of the record, the record itself is not included\r\ndescendants      Returns direct and indirect children of the record, self is not included\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nchildren?                   are there any children for this record\r\nparent?                     is there a parent record for this record\r\nupdate_children_recursive   reset the tree from the record's parent down to last descendant\r\nmove_to(destination_parent) move this record to another.  Also updates bothe source and \r\n                            destination tress\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nKlass.reset_lineage_tree    Reset the entire tree\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Options for has_lineage\r\n\r\n```\r\n:parent_key_column foreign key to the parent record, defaults to :parent_id\r\n:lineage_column    column_name storing the ancestry path, defaults to :lineage \r\n:leaf_width        the length of each ancestry path key, defaults to 4.\r\n                   4 means: max siblings 9999, ~ max tree depth of 51 levels with 256 byte string. \r\n:delimiter         the path separtor, defaults to '/'\r\n:tree_key_column   foreign key or value that separates trees, defaults to nil.\r\n                   use this option to add to categorize or differentiate trees.\r\n:order_column      column name used to order the siblings, defaults to nil \r\n:counter_cache     true/false, defaults to false. use to use Rails counter_cache\r\n                   if true must add field :lineage_children_count to table\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.

That research yeilded the following:\r\n\r\n#### Adjacency List\r\n* Each record has a key to its immediate parent.\r\n\r\n#### Materialised Path / Path Enumeration\r\n* Each record has a field containing complete line of its ancestry all the way up to the root.\r\n\r\n#### Nested Sets.\r\n* Each record has keys to the record immediatly left and right of its position the hierarchical chain.\r\n\r\n#### Closure Table\r\n* The complete line of its ancestry all the way up to the root is maintained as separate records in a separate table.\r\n\r\n## How do they stack up against each other\r\n\r\nHere are comparisons:\r\n\r\n* [Taxonomic Trees in PostgreSQL](http://gbif.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/taxonomic-trees-in-postgresql.html)\r\n* [Models for hierarchical data by Bill Karwin](http://www.slideshare.net/billkarwin/models-for-hierarchical-data)\r\n* [Trees In The Database - Advanced data structures by Lorenzo Alberton](http://www.slideshare.net/quipo/trees-in-the-database-advanced-data-structures)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nEach one has its own particular strengths and your choice should be guided by how you are using your data/tree.  Me, I am leaning toward Closure Table as it separates the admin from the actual data file and sets you up to take advantage an ordered btree index (e.g. Materialised Path). I have not made immediate plans to move this gem in that direction as yet, especially since another developer has already done so.\r\n\r\n## Other gems\r\n\r\nHere are other gems that handle this particular problem and based on the various patterns mentioned above:\r\n\r\n* [Ancestry](https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry)\r\n* [Use PostgreSQL LTREE type with ActiveRecord](https://github.com/RISCfuture/hierarchy)\r\n* [Closure Tree](https://github.com/mceachen/closure_tree)\r\n* [An awesome replacement for acts_as_nested_set](https://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set)\r\n* [Acts as tree for Rails 3](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/acts_as_tree_rails3)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
